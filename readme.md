# IoT-MQTT-Utils
This project is designed to simulate sensor data for testing purposes. It includes virtual sensors for Air Quality Sensor (live), Noise Sensor (historical), and Ambient Temperature Sensor (live). The project files should be placed inside the assets folder, and a sample assets folder is included.

## Setting up the Virtual Sensor
To set up and use the Virtual Sensor, follow these steps:

1. Run the Credentials Installer.
2. Follow the prompts to configure your credentials. This will generate a "credentials.json" file in the assets directory.
3. Make sure the assets folder is in the same directory as the Virtual Sensor.
4. Run the Virtual Sensor.
5. The Virtual Sensor will now be able to read sensor data and perform its functionality.

Note: The "credentials.json" file generated by the Credentials Installer is specific to the PC on which it is generated and cannot be used on other PCs.

## Testing the Ambient Sensor
You can test the ambient sensor by running the "Ambient_Sensor.py" file.

## Required Libraries
Make sure to install the required libraries as listed on the pipfile.

## Bonus Tools
This project also includes a Identifier Monitoring Tool and a Message Size Optimizer for added functionality.
